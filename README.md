> :warning: **Note:** These templates were created using Blender 3.1. Except where otherwise noted, they will likely work on any 3.x version.

## Installation

Pre-packaged versions of these templates are available from the [Releases](https://github.com/Drakmyth/blender-app-templates/releases) page. The templates can also be installed manually.

1. Navigate to the `scripts/startup/bl_app_templates_user` directory
    1. Create this directory if it doesn't exist

## Issues

If you have identified a bug that seems to come from one of the scripts bundled with one of these templates, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest version of the template. Old versions of templates are unsupported.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of Blender. Templates will not be backported to older versions.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.

## Contributions

These templates are open source! That means if you have an idea for how to improve them in some way, you can make those changes and submit a pull request! Because it is difficult to compare Blender files against each other, make sure to describe all of the changes you made and how they improve the template. If your changes require addons that do not come bundled with Blender, you should also provide a link to where the addons can be acquired.
